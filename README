Zoomy can make life easier on the eyes. ^_^

New Features
------------
Zoomy recent release has a new feature which enables the Zoom image Thumbnail to be a actually downsized copy of the full-sized image. Also the Zoom Image is now preloaded before Zoomy is initiated.

Upcoming Features
-----------------
We are currently in the process of adding a event handler so that the developer is allowed to define a event in which the zoomy will initiate.
